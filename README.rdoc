== Welcome to the Quiz

This is a quick quiz written in Rails 3 using angular.js for the front end. It's my first angular experiment.

A user can create an account, login, take a quiz and(soon) view the results

== Where are the codez?

Take a look at the following folders to get an idea of how the front end works:

/assets/views/templates

/assets/javascripts/desk.js

Controllers and models are located in their typcial Rails directories
